/**
 * Common benchmarking infrastructure for Token-Sheriff project.
 * <p>
 * This package provides a comprehensive benchmarking framework built on JMH
 * (Java Microbenchmark Harness) that automatically generates artifacts during
 * benchmark execution, including:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Performance badges (shields.io compatible JSON)</li>
 *   <li>HTML reports with embedded CSS</li>
 *   <li>Structured metrics in JSON format</li>
 *   <li>GitHub Pages deployment structure</li>
 *   <li>CI/CD summary files</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The infrastructure supports both micro-benchmarks and integration benchmarks,
 * with automatic detection based on package naming conventions.
