/**
 * Signals a failure of outbound IdP transport in the {@code commons.transport} layer.
 * <p>
 * The branches this layer currently raises are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>an SSRF-blocked egress target — the URL has no resolvable host, or it resolves to a
 *       loopback/link-local/site-local/any-local/multicast/unique-local address (see
 *       {@code EgressPolicy})</li>
 *   <li>an oversized or malformed IdP response — the well-known/JWKS payload exceeds the configured
 *       size ceiling or trips a parser security limit (see {@code WellKnownConfigurationConverter})</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * At an HTTP edge this maps to a 5xx {@code application/problem+json} document (typically
 * 502/503), distinct from token-validation failures which map to 401 (see
 * {@code doc/commons/specification/error-model.adoc}).
 *
 * @since 1.0
