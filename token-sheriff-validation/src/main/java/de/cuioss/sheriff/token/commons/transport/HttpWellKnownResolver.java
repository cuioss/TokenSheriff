/**
 * HTTP-based implementation for resolving OpenID Connect well-known configuration endpoints.
 * <p>
 * This class provides a thin wrapper around {@link HttpAdapter} for loading and
 * parsing well-known OIDC discovery documents. It handles HTTP operations, caching via ETag,
 * and provides convenient access to discovered endpoints.
 * <p>
 * The resolver loads the well-known configuration once and caches the result for
 * subsequent endpoint lookups. It provides methods to access common OIDC endpoints
 * like JWKS URI, issuer, authorization endpoint, etc.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Thread Safety:</strong> a cached success is served through a lock-free {@code AtomicReference}
 * fast path, while the side-effecting (re)load — the SSRF egress check, the blocking HTTP fetch, and the
 * status transitions — runs under a single-flight monitor so only one thread loads per refresh and racing
 * callers reuse the winning result. The load is deliberately kept out of any {@code updateAndGet} callback,
 * whose function may re-run under CAS contention.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Caching semantics (M2):</strong> only <em>successful</em> discovery results are cached,
 * and each cached success carries a bounded time-to-live ({@link #DISCOVERY_SUCCESS_TTL}). Once the
 * TTL elapses the next lookup revalidates against the endpoint, so discovery metadata cannot be
 * pinned indefinitely. A <em>failed</em> discovery is never cached — it is retried on the next call
 * rather than being pinned as a permanent negative result.
 *
 * @since 1.0
