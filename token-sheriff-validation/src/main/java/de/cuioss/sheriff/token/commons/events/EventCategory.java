 * Categorizes security events by their type and impact.

 * <ul>
 *   <li>InvalidStructure: For malformed tokens, size violations, etc. (typically thrown by NonValidatingJwtParser or TokenHeaderValidator). Usually maps to HTTP 401.</li>
 *   <li>InvalidSignature: For signature verification failures (typically thrown by TokenSignatureValidator). Usually maps to HTTP 401.</li>
 *   <li>SemanticIssues: For semantic validation failures (typically thrown by TokenClaimValidator, e.g., time or audience issues). Usually maps to HTTP 401.</li>
