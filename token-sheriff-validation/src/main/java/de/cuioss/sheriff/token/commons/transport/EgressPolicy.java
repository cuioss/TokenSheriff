/**
 * Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) egress guard for IdP-controlled URLs.
 * <p>
 * IdP-advertised endpoints (discovery {@code jwks_uri}, well-known documents) are
 * attacker-influenceable: a spoofed discovery document can advertise a {@code jwks_uri}
 * pointing at an internal, loopback, or cloud-metadata address
 * (e.g. {@code http://169.254.169.254/...}). This guard resolves a URL's host to its
 * {@link InetAddress}(es) immediately before the fetch and rejects any resolution that
 * lands in a disallowed range, closing the SSRF vector and — by resolving fresh at the
 * fetch site rather than trusting an earlier resolution — the DNS-rebinding vector.
 * <p>
 * The default posture is secure ({@link #secureDefault()}): loopback, link-local
 * (which covers the {@code 169.254.0.0/16} IPv4 cloud-metadata range and
 * {@code fe80::/10}), site-local ({@code 10/8}, {@code 172.16/12}, {@code 192.168/16}),
 * IPv6 unique-local ({@code fc00::/7}), wildcard, and multicast addresses are all
 * rejected. Both relaxations are explicit, discoverable inputs, never an implicit
 * test-mode:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link EgressPolicyBuilder#allowLoopback(boolean) allowLoopback} — permit
 *       loopback resolutions (for local development and MockWebServer-based tests
 *       fetching from {@code localhost}); all other blocked ranges still apply.</li>
 *   <li>{@link EgressPolicyBuilder#allowedHost(String) allowedHost} — an explicit
 *       host allow-list whose entries bypass address-range checks entirely.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A rejection raises the typed {@link TransportException} SSRF-blocked branch.
