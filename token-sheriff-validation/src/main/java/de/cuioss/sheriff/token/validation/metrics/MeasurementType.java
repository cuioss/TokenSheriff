/**
 * Enum defining all measurement types for JWT validation pipeline steps.
 * <p>
 * Each measurement type represents a specific phase of the JWT validation process
 * that can be independently monitored and analyzed for performance optimization.
 * <p>
 * The enum constants are ordered by their execution sequence in the validation pipeline (ordinals 0-9).
 * This natural ordering makes it easy to identify pipeline flow and bottlenecks by ordinal value.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Pipeline Execution Order (Access Token):</strong>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>COMPLETE_VALIDATION (0) - Wraps entire validation</li>
 *   <li>TOKEN_PARSING (1) - Decode Base64URL and parse JSON</li>
 *   <li>ISSUER_EXTRACTION (2) - Extract issuer claim</li>
 *   <li>CACHE_LOOKUP (3) - Check cache before expensive operations</li>
 *   <li>ISSUER_CONFIG_RESOLUTION (4) - Resolve issuer configuration</li>
 *   <li>HEADER_VALIDATION (5) - Validate JWT header</li>
 *   <li>SIGNATURE_VALIDATION (6) - Cryptographic verification (most expensive)</li>
 *   <li>TOKEN_BUILDING (7) - Build typed token object</li>
 *   <li>CLAIMS_VALIDATION (8) - Validate token claims</li>
 *   <li>CACHE_STORE (9) - Store validated token in cache</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Pipeline Usage:</strong>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>AccessTokenValidationPipeline</strong>: Uses ordinals 0-9 for complete instrumentation</li>
 *   <li><strong>IdTokenValidationPipeline</strong>: No metrics (uses NoOpMetricsTicker)</li>
 *   <li><strong>RefreshTokenValidationPipeline</strong>: No metrics (uses NoOpMetricsTicker)</li>
 * </ul>
