# Claude Code Configuration

All AI development guidelines for this project live in **`agents.md`** (hardlinked to `AGENTS.md`).
Refer to that file for dev-environment tips, build commands, testing instructions, code style,
and framework-specific standards when working on Token-Sheriff.

## Temporary Files

- Use `.plan/temp/` for ALL temporary files (covered by the `Write(.plan/**)` permission — avoids permission prompts).

## Git Workflow

Branch protection on `main` forbids direct pushes. Always:

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
2. Commit: `git add <files> && git commit -m "<message>"`
3. Push: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
4. Open a PR against `main` via `gh pr create --repo cuioss/TokenSheriff`
5. Wait for CI + AI reviewer(s): `gh pr checks --watch`
6. Address every AI-reviewer comment — reply with the reason for fixing or not fixing, and resolve it. If uncertain, ask the user first.
7. Do **not** enable auto-merge unless explicitly instructed.
8. After merge, return to `main`: `git checkout main && git pull`

## Tool Usage

- Use proper tools (Edit, Read, Write) instead of shell commands (echo, cat)
- Never use Bash for file operations (find, grep, cat, ls) — use Glob, Read, Grep tools instead
