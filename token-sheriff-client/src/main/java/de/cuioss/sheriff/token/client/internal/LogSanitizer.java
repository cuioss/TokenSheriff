/**
 * Sanitizes an externally-sourced value before it is interpolated into a {@code %s} log template,
 * defending against log injection / log forging (CWE-117).
 * <p>
 * Several call sites log a value that crossed a trust boundary before it was rejected — the RFC 9207
 * {@code iss} authorization-response parameter (fully attacker-controlled via the browser callback),
 * a caller-supplied {@code post_logout_redirect_uri}, or the {@code issuer} of an authorization
 * server's discovery document. Parameterized logging alone does not neutralize embedded {@code CR} /
 * {@code LF} on a plain-text appender — the substituted value is still written verbatim, so an
 * attacker who embeds {@code %0d%0a} can forge a new, seemingly legitimate log entry. This sanitizer
 * escapes (rather than drops) {@code CR}, {@code LF}, tab, and the remaining ASCII control characters,
 * preserving the value's investigative content while making it impossible to inject a line break.
 * <p>
 * The value is also truncated to {@value #MAX_LENGTH} characters before escaping, so an attacker
 * cannot flood the log with an arbitrarily long value (L18). When truncation occurs the marker
 * {@value #TRUNCATION_MARKER} is appended so the elision is visible in the log.
 *
 * @since 1.0
