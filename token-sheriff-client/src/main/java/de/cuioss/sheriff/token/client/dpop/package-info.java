/**
 * Sender-constraining for retrieved access tokens — DPoP (RFC 9449) and mTLS-bound (RFC 8705),
 * {@code CLIENT-11}.
 * <p>
 * {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.dpop.DpopProofGenerator} builds the per-request DPoP proof
 * JWT and exposes the proof-key thumbprint ({@code cnf.jkt});
 * {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.dpop.SenderConstraint} applies the DPoP proof header (or,
 * for mTLS, relies on the transport-level certificate binding) to the token request and records the
 * resulting {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.dpop.ConstraintBinding}. The binding is carried
 * alongside the stored token by the token-lifecycle increment so the constraint survives storage and
 * refresh ({@code CLIENT-18}). Verifying that a presented token matches its confirmed key is
 * inherited from the validation pipeline ({@code VALIDATION-8.7}) and is not re-implemented here.
 *
 * @since 1.0
