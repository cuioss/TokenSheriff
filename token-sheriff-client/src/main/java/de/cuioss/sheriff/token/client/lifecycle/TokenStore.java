/**
 * Service-provider interface for the server-side token store ({@code CLIENT-19}, design fork 2).
 * <p>
 * The engine keeps retrieved tokens server-side, off the browser, keyed by an opaque session
 * identifier. It does not force the stateful-vs-stateless choice on the relying party: the default
 * {@link InMemoryTokenStore} suffices for a single instance, while a BFF that needs a persistent,
 * shared store (Redis, a database, an encrypted cache) plugs its own implementation without changing
 * the engine.
 * <p>
 * Implementations MUST be thread-safe — concurrent flows for different sessions, and concurrent
 * refresh/logout for the same session, operate on the store simultaneously ({@code CLIENT-22}).
 * {@link #remove(String)} MUST be atomic: it returns the removed bundle so a logout can take-and-clear
 * a session's tokens in one step, with no window in which another flow observes a token that is being
 * revoked.
