/**
 * Decides when a stored access token should be proactively refreshed ({@code CLIENT-17}).
 * <p>
 * Short-lived access tokens are refreshed a little before they expire, so a request never carries an
 * already-expired token and there is no user-visible re-authentication. This is a pure policy object:
 * it computes <em>whether</em> a bundle is inside its refresh window; performing the refresh (and
 * preserving the sender-constraint across it) is {@link TokenLifecycleManager}'s job.
 * <p>
 * A token whose expiry is unknown ({@link StoredToken#expiresAt()} is {@code null}) is never
 * proactively refreshed — there is no basis to schedule it.
