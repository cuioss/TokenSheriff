/**
 * The outcome of an OAuth 2.0 {@code refresh_token} exchange
 * ({@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.flow.RefreshFlow}).
 * <p>
 * Carries the freshly validated access token, the refresh token to present on the next refresh,
 * the refreshed ID token (when the AS issued one), and whether the authorization server rotated the
 * refresh token. When {@link #rotated()} is {@code true} the {@link #refreshToken()} is the
 * AS-issued successor and the presented token has been superseded; when {@code false} the AS chose
 * not to rotate (RFC 6749 §6 permits omitting a new refresh token) and {@link #refreshToken()} is
 * the still-valid presented token.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #idToken()} is the raw ID token the AS returned on the refresh, or {@code null} when it
 * omitted one (OIDC Core §12.2 makes the ID token optional on refresh). The lifecycle wiring
 * verifies its {@code iss}/{@code sub} consistency against the validated access token before it is
 * carried forward, rather than silently preserving the pre-refresh ID token.
 * <p>
 * {@link #grantedScope()} and {@link #scopeDelta()} report the outcome of reconciling the scope the
 * authorization server actually granted against the scope this client requested. This is
 * <strong>anomaly reporting, not compliance enforcement</strong>: RFC 6749 §3.3 affirmatively permits
 * an authorization server to grant a scope other than the one requested, obliging it only to disclose
 * the result through the {@code scope} response parameter, and the resource server — not this client —
 * remains the enforcement point for an over-broad claim. In the default lenient posture a
 * {@link ScopeDelta#BROADENED} outcome is therefore surfaced for the calling application to act on,
 * never presented as a protocol violation. The opt-in
 * {@code ClientConfiguration.strictScopeReconciliation} posture is the deliberate exception: it
 * refuses the broadened grant with a {@code ClientProtocolException} before a {@code RotationResult}
 * is ever constructed, so a strict-mode caller never observes a {@link ScopeDelta#BROADENED}
 * instance at all.
 *

 * @param idToken                   the raw refreshed ID token, or {@code null} when the AS omitted it
 * @param accessTokenExpiresInSeconds the access token lifetime in seconds; {@code 0} means no known
 *                                  expiry — the AS omitted {@code expires_in}, or sent a non-positive
 *                                  value or an implausible one beyond {@link TokenResponse}'s

 *                                  {@code null} when it omitted the parameter. {@code null} does
 *                                  <strong>not</strong> mean "no scope was granted": RFC 6749 §5.1
 *                                  defines an omitted {@code scope} as identical to the requested
 *                                  scope, so an absent value means "as requested", and the
 *                                  accompanying {@link #scopeDelta()} is {@link ScopeDelta#UNDECLARED}
