/**
 * Mutual-TLS certificate-bound client authentication (RFC 8705, {@code tls_client_auth}).
 * <p>
 * Mutual-TLS authenticates the client by the TLS client certificate presented during the
 * handshake — a transport-layer binding that must be configured as an {@code SSLContext} carrying
 * the client key material on the {@code HttpHandler}. No code path currently plumbs such an
 * {@code SSLContext} into the transport, so a {@code tls_client_auth} request would leave the
 * client without a bound certificate — an <em>unauthenticated</em> request. Rather than silently
 * producing that request (or leaning on a process-global default {@code SSLContext}), this strategy
 * <strong>fails fast at construction</strong> until the transport can honor mTLS (H4). No
 * {@code SSLContext} plumbing is added speculatively.
