/**
 * The normalized OpenID Connect userinfo response (OIDC Core §5.3.2).
 * <p>
 * Produced by {@link UserInfoClient} from a successful userinfo request. The {@code sub} claim is the
 * identity-critical field: it MUST be bound back to the validated ID token's {@code sub} by
 * {@link SubBindingValidator} before any claim here is trusted — an unsigned userinfo document is
 * transport-authenticated only, so its identity is never taken on its own.
 * <p>
 * Parsing uses DSL-JSON's compile-time {@code @CompiledJson} mapping. Fields are {@code public}
 * because DSL-JSON class-based deserialization requires it; after deserialization the object is
 * treated as read-only and callers should use the accessor methods.
