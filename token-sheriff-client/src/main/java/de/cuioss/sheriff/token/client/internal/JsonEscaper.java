/**
 * Escapes a string for embedding in a hand-rolled JSON string literal, per
 * <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259#section-7">RFC 8259 §7</a>.
 * <p>
 * The {@code private_key_jwt} client assertion ({@code auth.PrivateKeyJwtAuth}) and the DPoP proof
 * JWT ({@code dpop.DpopProofGenerator}) build their header/payload JSON by hand rather than through a
 * general-purpose JSON library, so every string member (including values sourced from the
 * authorization server's own discovery metadata — the token endpoint URL used as the DPoP
 * {@code htu}, or the assertion {@code aud}) must be escaped here before it is embedded. Escaping the
 * backslash and quote characters alone (as a naive hand-rolled escaper commonly does) prevents an
 * embedded quote from breaking out of the JSON string, but RFC 8259 requires every other ASCII
 * control character to be escaped too; an un-escaped control character in an AS-supplied URL would
 * otherwise produce invalid JSON. This is defense-in-depth (canonicalize-before-use), not a
 * primary injection defense — the primary defense against structural injection remains the
 * quote/backslash escaping, which is preserved unchanged.
 *
