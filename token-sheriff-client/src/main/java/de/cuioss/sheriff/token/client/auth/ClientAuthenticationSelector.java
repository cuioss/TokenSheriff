/**
 * Selects the strongest client-authentication method the authorization server advertises.
 * <p>
 * Given the client's configured authentication strategies and the AS
 * {@code token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported} metadata (RFC 8414), the selector picks the strategy
 * with the highest {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.config.ClientAuthMethod#getStrength()
 * strength} that the AS supports — preferring {@code private_key_jwt} over a shared secret, and
 * never silently downgrading to a shared secret where a stronger method is both configured and
 * advertised. When the AS advertises no configured method, selection fails closed.
 * <p>
 * {@code tls_client_auth} is <strong>never selected</strong>: mutual-TLS is a transport-layer
 * binding that the current transport cannot honor (no {@code SSLContext} client key material is
 * plumbed), so selecting it would produce an unauthenticated request. The selector skips it even
 * when the AS advertises it, so a working {@code client_secret_basic} is preferred rather than
 * silently downgraded to a non-functional mTLS method (H4).
