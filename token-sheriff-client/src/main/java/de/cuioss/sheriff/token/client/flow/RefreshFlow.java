/**
 * Drives the OAuth 2.0 {@code refresh_token} grant (RFC 6749 §6) with refresh-token rotation.
 * <p>
 * The flow builds the {@code grant_type=refresh_token} request, applies the configured
 * {@link ClientAuthentication} strategy (deliverable 3), exchanges it at the token endpoint through
 * {@link TokenEndpointClient}, and validates the returned access token through the
 * {@link TokenValidationBridge} ({@code CLIENT-15}). It returns only a validated token — a
 * successful HTTP exchange alone is never trusted.
 * <p>
 * When the authorization server issues a new refresh token (rotation, per the OAuth 2.0 Security
 * BCP), the {@link RotationResult} reports the rotated token and flags the rotation; the caller
 * feeds that transition into its {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.token.RefreshTokenFamily} so
 * a later replay of a superseded token is detected and the family revoked ({@code CLIENT-17}).
 * The family refuses such a replay, and every call on an already-revoked family, with
 * {@link RefreshTokenFamilyRevokedException}. That refusal is <strong>session-ending</strong>: the
 * caller owes it a revocation at the authorization server (RFC 7009, best-effort) and a clear of both
 * its stored token bundle and the family, forcing re-authentication — what
 * {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.lifecycle.TokenLifecycleManager} does. A caller that runs
 * {@code refresh} and {@code rotate} in one {@code try} may route the refusal through
 * {@link #classify(Throwable)}, which never reads it as pre-redemption.
 * <p>
 * The flow also reconciles the scope the authorization server granted against the scope this client
 * requested, and reports the outcome on the {@link RotationResult}
 * ({@link RotationResult.ScopeDelta}). This is <strong>anomaly reporting, not compliance
 * enforcement</strong>: RFC 6749 §3.3 permits the server to grant a scope other than the one
 * requested provided it discloses the result, and the resource server remains the enforcement point
 * for an over-broad claim. A broadened grant is therefore accepted and {@code WARN}-logged by
 * default; it is refused with {@link ClientProtocolException} only when the deployment opts in via
 * {@code ClientConfiguration.strictScopeReconciliation}.
 * <p>
 * Both the validation refusal and the strict-posture scope refusal are raised <em>after</em> the token
 * endpoint has answered, and therefore after the authorization server has redeemed and possibly
 * rotated the presented refresh token — as is an unparseable success response, where rotation cannot
 * be determined at all. A caller holding a session cannot tell from the exception type alone whether
 * the token it still has stored is alive or dead, so each of those refusals <em>carries</em> the
 * {@link RefreshRedemption} it was raised under ({@link RedeemedRefreshFailure}), and
 * {@link #classify(Throwable)} reads it back. The validation refusal is caught by type, and that catch
 * is sufficient by construction: every request-path guard in the validation pipeline raises the
 * declared {@code TokenValidationException}, enforced by that module's {@code UncheckedThrowBoundaryTest},
 * so no pipeline failure can bypass this arm and be read as pre-redemption.
 * <p>
 * A failure raised before that point carries no redemption, and {@code classify} splits that region in
 * two rather than collapsing it. Most of it is
 * {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#PRE_REDEMPTION} — a connection failure, a DNS failure, an
 * SSRF-blocked target, a {@code 5xx} — where the presented token is untouched, which is what keeps a
 * transient network fault from being mistaken for a burned credential. The exception is a {@code 4xx}
 * the authorization server attributed to the credential itself (RFC 6749 §5.2 {@code invalid_grant}),
 * raised as {@link CredentialRejectedException} and classified
 * {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#CREDENTIAL_REJECTED}: nothing was redeemed and there is no
 * successor, but the credential is dead and no retry will revive it.
 * <p>
 * The signal rides on the exception rather than on a separate observer argument deliberately:
 * {@link #refresh(ProviderMetadata, String)} stays the one overridable entry point on this
 * subclassable type, so a subclass that intercepts, instruments or stubs a refresh stays on the
 * production path instead of silently becoming dead code.

     * {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#PRE_REDEMPTION} for it, which is a statement about the
     * token exchange and says nothing about that other failure.
     * <p>
     * This is the single place the distinction is decided, and callers must use it rather than
     * enumerate exception types. It folds in the three cases that carry no redemption of their own:
     * {@link RedeemedResponseException}, a success status whose body could not be parsed, where no
     * {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.token.TokenResponse} is ever constructed and rotation is
     * therefore not computable even in principle — mapped to {@link RefreshRedemption#rotationUnknown()}
     * so the presented token is presumed burned with no successor to revoke; and
     * {@link CredentialRejectedException}, a {@code 4xx} the authorization server attributed to the
     * presented credential itself, which redeemed nothing but leaves the credential dead; and
     * {@link RefreshTokenFamilyRevokedException}, the family's reuse or already-revoked refusal.
     * <p>
     * The family refusal never classifies as pre-redemption, and which session-ending kind it gets
     * follows what the authorization server has already done. Raised by
     * {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.token.RefreshTokenFamily#rotate(String, String)}, it comes
     * after the server redeemed the presented token and issued the successor the refusal names, so it is
     * {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#REDEEMED} with {@link RefreshRedemption#rotated(String)} —
     * the successor is a live credential to revoke — or with {@link RefreshRedemption#rotationUnknown()}
     * on a deserialized instance that lost it. Raised by
     * {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.token.RefreshTokenFamily#currentToken()}, no exchange took
     * place and there is no successor, so it is
     * {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#CREDENTIAL_REJECTED}: nothing to revoke, but the session
     * must be cleared.
     * <p>
     * {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#PRE_REDEMPTION} means the request never reached the
     * point where the server processed the grant, so the presented refresh token is untouched and still
     * valid. Treating that as a redemption would destroy a working session over a transient network
     * fault; treating it as a rejected credential would do the same.
     * <p>
     * {@link RedeemedRefreshFailure} is tested first because it is an interface: a future refusal type
     * that both implements it and extends one of the named classes must be classified by the state it
     * carries, not by its class.
