/**
 * The server-side token bundle held for a single session ({@code CLIENT-18} / {@code CLIENT-19}).
 * <p>
 * A stored token keeps the retrieved token material off the browser: the access token, the optional
 * refresh token and ID token, the optional sender-constraint {@link ConstraintBinding} (from the
 * DPoP/mTLS increment), and the access-token expiry. Carrying the {@code ConstraintBinding} here is
 * what lets the sender-constraint survive storage and proactive refresh.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Refresh is proof-driven, not metadata-only.</strong> {@link #refreshed} does <em>not</em>
 * blindly copy the stored binding forward — that would let a sender-constrained session silently
 * degrade to a plain bearer token if the authorization server returned one on refresh. Instead the
 * caller passes the {@code cnf} binding actually confirmed on the <em>refreshed</em> token, and a
 * previously sender-constrained bundle refuses the refresh unless that binding still confirms the same
 * key ({@code CLIENT-18}). A downgrade to bearer, or a re-binding to a different key, fails closed.
 * <p>
 * The value object is immutable; a refresh produces a new {@code StoredToken} rather than mutating
 * shared state, so concurrent flows over the same session never observe a half-updated bundle.
