/**
 * OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0 authorization-server discovery for the client engine.
 * <p>
 * {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.discovery.DiscoveryResolver} fetches the AS
 * {@code .well-known/openid-configuration} document over the commons-blessed cui-http
 * {@code HttpHandler} (TLS enforced) and maps it into an immutable
 * {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.discovery.ProviderMetadata} — the resolved endpoint URLs
 * plus the capability flags (PKCE {@code S256}, PAR, DPoP, end-session) the flows branch on. The
 * package adds no transport hardening of its own; it inherits the handler's TLS/SSRF posture.
