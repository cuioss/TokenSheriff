/**
 * Runtime module of the Quarkus extension for the Token-Sheriff OIDC/OAuth client engine.
 * <p>
 * This extension binds the framework-agnostic {@code token-sheriff-client} engine into Quarkus. It is
 * a <em>separate</em> extension that depends on the existing {@code token-sheriff-validation-quarkus}
 * extension (reusing its validation CDI wiring) rather than folding the client into it — this keeps
 * opt-in clean: an application adds the client extension only when it needs the outbound flows.
 * The build-time counterpart lives in {@code token-sheriff-client-quarkus-deployment}.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Status:</strong> wired, empty skeleton (Plan 05). The extension registers the
 * {@code token-sheriff-client} feature and assembles against the reactor; runtime producers and
 * configuration land with the client flows (Plan 06).
