 * <p><strong>Context Dependency:</strong> When not in an appropriate request context (e.g., outside REST requests),

 * {@code @RequestScoped} HttpServerRequest producer cannot provide a valid instance. This is wrapped behavior -
 * implementations may throw {@link IllegalStateException} which gets wrapped by CDI.</p>
