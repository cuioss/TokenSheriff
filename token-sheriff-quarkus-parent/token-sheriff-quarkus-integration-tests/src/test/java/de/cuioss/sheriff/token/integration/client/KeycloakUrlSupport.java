/**
 * Bridges the two Keycloak base URLs the client integration tests must reconcile.
 * <p>
 * The integration realm is imported with a fixed {@code frontendUrl} of
 * {@code https://keycloak:8443} (see {@code src/main/docker/keycloak/integration-realm.json}).
 * Keycloak therefore emits that <em>Docker-internal</em> authority in every URL it generates —
 * the {@code issuer} in the discovery document, the {@code login-actions} form-action URL on the
 * login page, and the discovery-advertised endpoints such as the
 * {@code pushed_authorization_request_endpoint}. The application container reaches that authority
 * over the {@code jwt-integration} Docker network, which is why the app's issuer configuration is
 * pinned to {@code https://keycloak:8443/realms/...}.
 * <p>
 * The {@code *IT} tests, however, run on the CI runner <em>outside</em> the Docker network. There the
 * container is only reachable through the host port mapping {@code 1443:8443}
 * (see {@code docker-compose.yml}), i.e. {@code https://localhost:1443}; the {@code keycloak} DNS name
 * and the internal port {@code 8443} do not resolve. Tests that build their own request URL against
 * {@code https://localhost:1443} connect fine, but any test that <em>follows a Keycloak-emitted URL</em>
 * would connect to {@code https://keycloak:8443} and fail with a {@code java.net.ConnectException}.
 * <p>
 * This helper rewrites such Keycloak-emitted URLs to the externally reachable base while preserving the
 * path, query, and fragment. Rewriting to {@code localhost} additionally keeps the session cookies
 * (set by Keycloak on the {@code localhost} domain during the authorization request) valid for the
 * follow-up login POST.
